	abstract = {An accurate and reliable image based fruit detection system is critical for supporting higher level agriculture tasks such as yield mapping and robotic harvesting. This paper presents the use of a state-of-the-art object detection framework, Faster R-{CNN}, in the context of fruit detection in orchards, including mangoes, almonds and apples. Ablation studies are presented to better understand the practical deployment of the detection network, including how much training data is required to capture variability in the dataset. Data augmentation techniques are shown to yield significant performance gains, resulting in a greater than two-fold reduction in the number of training images required. In contrast, transferring knowledge between orchards contributed to negligible performance gain over initialising the Deep Convolutional Neural Network directly from {ImageNet} features. Finally, to operate over orchard data containing between 100-1000 fruit per image, a tiling approach is introduced for the Faster R-{CNN} framework. The study has resulted in the best yet detection performance for these orchards relative to previous works, with an F1-score of {\textgreater}0.9 achieved for apples and mangoes.},

	abstract = {This work details the development and validation of an algorithm for estimating the number of apples in color images acquired in orchards under natural illumination. Ultimately, this algorithm is intended to enable estimation of the orchard yield and be part of a management decision support system. The algorithm includes four main steps: detection of pixels that have a high probability of belonging to apples, using color and smoothness; formation and extension of “seed areas”, which are connected sets of pixels that have a high probability of belonging to apples; segmentation of the contours of these seed areas into arcs and amorphous segments; and combination of these arcs and comparison of the resulting circle with a simple model of an apple. The performance of the algorithm is investigated using two datasets. The first dataset consists of images recorded in full automatic mode of the camera and under various lighting conditions. Although the algorithm detects correctly more than 85\% of the apples visible in the images, direct illumination and color saturation cause a large number of false positive detections. The second dataset consists of images that were manually underexposed and recorded under mostly diffusive light (close to sunset). For such images the correct detection rate is close to 95\% while the false positive detection rate is less than 5\%.},
